# Antonys-macro-repeater
**DISCLAIMER**: this was *flagrantly stolen* from this [stackexchange answer](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/11210/can-i-repeat-a-macro-with-the-dot-operator). If you use this snippet please give Antony some kind of upvote somewhere.

A basic wrapper around vim's builtin `@` to allow you to repeat macros with the `.` operator. You can repeat macros right after recording them, or right after using them as a replacement for `@@`.

# Installation
It is a single file snippet that can either be downloaded as a plugin with your favorite package manager (I use [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)). You can also simply copy `Antonys-macro-repeater.vim` into your vimrc or wherever you keep random functions. Please send me issues if you happen to install this and uncover any at all (or pull requests if you decide to fix them).
