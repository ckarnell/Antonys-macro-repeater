# Antonys-macro-repeater
Repeat macros with the '.' operator in vim. Allows you to repeat macros after using them as a replacement for `@@`, or after recording them.

**DISCLAIMER**: this was *flagrantly stolen* from this [stackexchange answer](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/11210/can-i-repeat-a-macro-with-the-dot-operator).

It is a single file snippet that can either be downloaded as a plugin, or simply copied into your vimrc or wherever you keep random functions.
